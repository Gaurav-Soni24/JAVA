# ☕ Java Preparation Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Java Prep repo! I'm currently on a **4–5 month grind** to master **Core Java**, build with **Spring Boot**, and crush **DSA** – all to secure a **high-paying dev internship (₹40K/month+)** 💼💰

## 🎯 Vision

This repo is my personal space to:
- Build strong fundamentals in **Core Java** 🧠
- Learn and create backend apps using **Spring Boot** ⚙️
- Practice **DSA daily** for cracking online rounds + interviews 🧩
- Track progress and create a roadmap for others too 📚
